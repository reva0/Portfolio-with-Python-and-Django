# Portfolio-with-Python-and-Django

The project running on your localhost uses Python 3, Django, CSS and HTML. This is a basic website that has all the necessary files and headings that is needed to build public portfolio.  

Django website is a single project that is split into separate apps. Each app handles a self-contained function that the site needs and is expected to perform. 

Objects can also be added from the website by navigating from your local host to " ..../admin/login/?next=/admin/jobs/prevjob/".

Page source is similar to getbootstrap.com. To change the layout of the portfolio / add new data edit in home.html. To add images, add in static.
